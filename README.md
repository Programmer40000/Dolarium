I have taken some time off due to changing interests but I have returned to resume work on Dolarium. I'm currently cleaning up the code to make sure it functions correctly. As I have said previously I hope to release Dolarium in it's entirety soon so stay tuned. I just hope I can retain my focus on it anyway I will let you know what is happening next in the next update. See you all later.
